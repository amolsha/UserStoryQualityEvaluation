You are an expert in generating datasets for the evaluation of the research work concerning user story quality evaluation.

I am writing a research paper on user story quality evaluation using Large Language Models (LLMs).
My paper is based on Quality User Story (QUS) framework. QUS framework defines 13 quality criteria for User Story quality. 
QUS framework’s criteria are organized in following 3 categories: 
‘Syntactic quality’, concerning the textual structure of a user story without considering its meaning; 
‘Semantic quality’, concerning the relations and meaning of (parts of) the user story text; 
‘Pragmatic quality’, considers the audience’s subjective interpretation of the user story text aside from syntax and semantics.   

The 13 quality criteria are described as below:   

Note: The last word (Individual/ Set) classifies the criteria depending on whether they relate to an individual user story or to a set of user stories.   
Syntactic 
1.       Well-formed: A user story includes at least a role and a means. Individual 2.       Atomic: A user story expresses a requirement for exactly one feature. Individual 3.       Minimal: A user story contains nothing more than role, means, and ends. Individual 
Semantic 
1.       Conceptually sound: The means expresses a feature and the ends expresses a rationale. Individual 2.       Problem-oriented: A user story only specifies the problem, not the solution to it. Individual 3.       Unambiguous: A user story avoids terms or abstractions that lead to multiple interpretations. Individual 4.       Conflict-free: A user story should not be inconsistent with any other user story. Set 
Pragmatic 
1.       Full sentence: A user story is a well-formed full sentence. Individual 2.       Estimatable: A story does not denote a coarse-grained requirement that is difficult to plan and prioritize. Individual 3.       Unique: Every user story is unique, duplicates are avoided. Set 4.       Uniform: All user stories in a specification employ the same template. Set 5.       Independent: The user story is self-contained and has no inherent dependencies on other stories. Set 6.       Complete: Implementing a set of user stories creates a feature-complete application, no steps are missing. Set     

Out of the quality criteria mentioned above, we shall be working on the quality criteria applicable to 'Individual' user story.

My proposed method is to use LLM to evaluate an input user story for each of these 8 criterion and output whether the criterion is possessed by the user story or not (Yes/No).

I'll be evaluating my results using three LLMs: GPT-4o, GPT-4-Turbo, GPT-3.5-Turbo.

We follow the following format for writing user story: As a <role>, I want to <means>, so that <ends>.     Help me in evaluating the quality of user stories I have. 


For the evaluation of my proposed approach, I want to generate synthetic dataset
of user stories with your help. 

Please generate the 30 user stories that meets and 30 user stories that does not meet <name of criterion> criterion.
